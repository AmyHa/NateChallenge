#  Nate Technical Test

The link to the technical test can be found [here](https://github.com/NateAI/nate.challenge.ios):

The aim was to meet the core deliverables, plus one of the advanced deliverables: unit test coverage.

In an ideal world, I would have implemented animations, displayed multiple images in the DetailViewController (in my mind, I imagined the images displayed as a carousel using `UICollectionView` and `UIPageControl`), and more UI testing.

I have incorporated the TDD approach in some parts of the development, by starting with the foundations first e.g. the models, services and view models followed by the views. The architectural pattern of this app is MVVM-C.
